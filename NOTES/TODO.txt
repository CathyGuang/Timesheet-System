- see if I can use the Tel form element to ensure that administrators creating new volunteers/clients/staff are forced to input consistent telephone numbers?
  - make SQL restrictions to columns to ensure that only properly formatted data gets added. Return errors to users.


- if time permits, switch all "other objects" from ENUMS to single column tables. This would make editing and deleting easier.



NEXT: classes can now be created! Next allow classes to be edited (by admin) and managed (by staff).
      - then do personal schedule pages,
      - then allow hours to be entered,
      - then allow reports to be generated.


- Add REMOVE option for all objects that are not enums, such as people, horses, classes, shifts
