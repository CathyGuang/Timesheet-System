INSTALL APACHE, PHP, AND POSTGRES
  - use Lynda tutorial to properly configure apache and php on windows

MAKE SURE APACHE IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED
  - NO INDEXING
  - NEED TO ADD .PHP FILES TO DirectoryIndex variable to serve php files.
  - MAKE SURE ACCESS TO .ht* FILES IS PROHIBITED
  - IN <Directory "${SRVROOT}/htdocs"> BLOCK, SET "AllowOverride All" TO ALLOW .htaccess FILES TO WORK
  - GENERATE HTPASSWD FILE WITH HTPASSWD.exe IN apache/bin WITH SPECIFIED PASSWORDS FOR staff AND admin
  - CREATE /apache/HTPASSWD DIRECTORY AND PLACE .htpasswd FILE THERE
  - DISABLE CENTOS 7 FIREWALL:
      - sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent && sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent
      - sudo systemctl restart firewalld

MAKE SURE PHP IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED
  - NEED TO MAKE SURE PGSQL EXTENSION IS ENABLED AND WORKS IN PHP.INI FILE
      - set extension_dir to ABSOLUTE path to the extensions folder in php
      - uncomment extension=pgsql line in php.ini file.
  - MAKE SURE TO USE PRODUCTION PHP.INI FILE (NO ERROR-REPORTING)

MAKE SURE PostgreSQL IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED
  - MAKE SURE
              # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
              local   all             postgres                                peer
              local   all             all                                     md5
              # IPv4 local connections:
              host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
      ARE BOTH IN PostgreSQL\11\data\pg_hba.conf FILE AT THE END

REMEMBER TO INCLUDE /static/dbinfo/ SUBDIRECTORY, IT IS NOT ON GIT. MOVE FROM MY LAPTOP
