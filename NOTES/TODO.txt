- see if I can use the Tel form element to ensure that administrators creating new volunteers/clients/staff are forced to input consistent telephone numbers?
  - make SQL restrictions to columns to ensure that only properly formatted data gets added. Return errors to users.


NEXT: Allow classes to be managed (by staff).
      - then do personal schedule pages,
      - then allow hours to be entered,
      - then allow reports to be generated.

- Allow classes/shifts/other objects to be ARCHIVED by admin, so that they remain in the database but disappear from all current editing/management menus
